  I stared my Quake project. I'm starting with sources of all first 2 Quake engines and Hexen 2.
  First step is to made all quake engines compile on Linux.
  For Quake I removed svgalib and 3dfx versions. GLX version required few changes to make it workable.
  Quake2 had some build errors in game code. OpenGL driver has only 3dfx version source so currently only software renderer works. It runs with GLX driver from original release. Crashes whes trying to start a game.
  Quake3 required a small change I borrowed from another port.
30.03.2010
  I made all projects compile on Windows. All project files were updated to Visual Studio 2008. I wasn't able to test anything.
  I made Hexen 2 and HexenWorld compile on Linux. All system code is from Quake.
  I created somewhat working OpenGL driver for Quake 2. It renders fine but input doesn't work.
  I found that build procedure of Quake 2 game was missing a file. It now works. Interestingly my compiled version works only with game I compiled and original version with original game file. One difference I noticed is that source code is version 3.19 but original binaries 3.20.
31.03.2010
  I cleaned up source from old text files, DirectX SDK files, DOS version of Quake files and more.
  In Quake 2 I found that in irix directory there's a fully working GLX driver implementation, so now I have all games working on Linux and OpenGL.
  I removed software renderers from all games that had them.
01.04.2010
  I removed game sources from all games except Quake 2. I left it in Quake 2 untill I can figure out why it doesn't run with original SO file.
  I got Hexen 2 working with original game and it's progs. Currently it's controlled with preprocessor switch so you need to recompile it for mission pack.
  On Linux I switched to CMake.
  I changed Quake 2 to have OpenGL driver built-in.
02.04.2010
  I converted all games to C++.
03.04.2010
  I created core library that will serve as a common base for all games. There I added memory mnager from my other project, this will eventually replace old memory management that uses big memory block and does management there, which even Quake 3 uses to some extent.
04.04.2010
  I added dynamic string and array classes to core. In string class I added static methods to replace standard string methods, changed all games to use them.
  I did some code cleanup.
05.04.2010
  I changed Quake 3 to use zlib and libjpeg as standalone libraries, updated them to latest versions.
06.04.2010
  I changed all games to use names Com_Memset and Com_Memcpy for respective functions.
  I started creating common network message class.
07.04.2010
  I did more work on message class. It's almost complete now. I also added separate class for use as command buffer.
  I moved Com_Memset and Com_Memcpy to core, using Quake 3 implementation. Linux assembly code crashes so it's disabled for now.
08.04.2010
  I moved vector math library to core.
  I moved string functions for dealing with file names and parsing to core as static QStr methods.
09.04.2010
  I moved CRC amd MD4 calculation and  command line argument handling functions to core.
10.04.2010
  I disabled asm code of Com_Memcpy and Com_Memset as it also causes problem on Windows.
  I moved most of the cvar code to core.
11.04.2010
  I changed q1 games to use new style of registering cvars.
  I moved command buffer and command execution to core.
13.04.2010
  I started work on unifying file systems. This should be last of the core subsystems that's used everywhere.
15.04.2010
  I fixed a bug I introduced in command parsing that caused Quake 3 to loose network key sync.
18.04.2010
  Work on file access has been completed and most remaining file system code is unifid too.
19.04.2010
  In Hexen 2 I added support for maplist.txt file that specifies alternate progs file for specific levels. Now boss levels work.
20.04.2010
  I finished replacing use of stdio with use of file system for game created files like savegames, config files, screenshots etc. and made them all to be created in home directory.
02.01.2011
  I decided to go through all previous changes and review them and make sure that there are no changes that break behavior in one of the games. Since in the beginning I didn't have game type variable, things that were merged first may need to be changed and take advantage of it.
04.01.2011
  In Quake 2 Cvar_SetValue was using non-force version of Cvar_Set, so I added separate version that uses it and replaced everywhere in Quake 2 to use it.
