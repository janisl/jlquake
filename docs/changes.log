  I stared my Quake project. I'm starting with sources of all first 2 Quake engines and Hexen 2.
  First step is to made all quake engines compile on Linux.
  For Quake I removed svgalib and 3dfx versions. GLX version required few changes to make it workable.
  Quake2 had some build errors in game code. OpenGL driver has only 3dfx version source so currently only software renderer works. It runs with GLX driver from original release. Crashes whes trying to start a game.
  Quake3 required a small change I borrowed from another port.

  I made all projects compile on Windows. All project files were updated to Visual Studio 2008. I wasn't able to test anything.
  I made Hexen 2 and HexenWorld compile on Linux. All system code is from Quake.
  I created somewhat working OpenGL driver for Quake 2. It renders fine but input doesn't work.
  I found that build procedure of Quake 2 game was missing a file. It now works. Interestingly my compiled version works only with game I compiled and original version with original game file. One difference I noticed is that source code is version 3.19 but original binaries 3.20.

  I cleaned up source from old text files, DirectX SDK files, DOS version of Quake files and more.
  In Quake 2 I found that in irix directory there's a fully working GLX driver implementation, so now I have all games working on Linux and OpenGL.
  I removed software renderers from all games that had them.

  I removed game sources from all games except Quake 2. I left it in Quake 2 untill I can figure out why it doesn't run with original DLL file.
  I got Hexen 2 working with original game and it's progs. Currently it's controlled with preprocessor switch so you need to recompile it for mission pack.
  On Linux I switched to CMake.
  I changed Quake 2 to have OpenGL driver built-in.
02.04.2010
  I converted all games to C++.
03.04.2010
  I created core library that will serve as a common base for all games. There I added memory mnager from my other project, this will eventually replace old memory management that uses big memory block and does management there, which even Quake 3 uses to some extent.
04.04.2010
  I added dynamic string and array classes to core. In string class I added static methods to replace standard string methods, changed all games to use them.
  I did some code cleanup.
