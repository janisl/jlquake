  I stared my Quake project. I'm starting with sources of all first 2 Quake engines and Hexen 2.
  First step is to made all quake engines compile on Linux.
  For Quake I removed svgalib and 3dfx versions. GLX version required few changes to make it workable.
  Quake2 had some build errors in game code. OpenGL driver has only 3dfx version source so currently only software renderer works. It runs with GLX driver from original release. Crashes whes trying to start a game.
  Quake3 required a small change I borrowed from another port.
30.03.2010
  I made all projects compile on Windows. All project files were updated to Visual Studio 2008. I wasn't able to test anything.
  I made Hexen 2 and HexenWorld compile on Linux. All system code is from Quake.
  I created somewhat working OpenGL driver for Quake 2. It renders fine but input doesn't work.
  I found that build procedure of Quake 2 game was missing a file. It now works. Interestingly my compiled version works only with game I compiled and original version with original game file. One difference I noticed is that source code is version 3.19 but original binaries 3.20.
31.03.2010
  I cleaned up source from old text files, DirectX SDK files, DOS version of Quake files and more.
  In Quake 2 I found that in irix directory there's a fully working GLX driver implementation, so now I have all games working on Linux and OpenGL.
  I removed software renderers from all games that had them.
01.04.2010
  I removed game sources from all games except Quake 2. I left it in Quake 2 untill I can figure out why it doesn't run with original SO file.
  I got Hexen 2 working with original game and it's progs. Currently it's controlled with preprocessor switch so you need to recompile it for mission pack.
  On Linux I switched to CMake.
  I changed Quake 2 to have OpenGL driver built-in.
02.04.2010
  I converted all games to C++.
03.04.2010
  I created core library that will serve as a common base for all games. There I added memory mnager from my other project, this will eventually replace old memory management that uses big memory block and does management there, which even Quake 3 uses to some extent.
04.04.2010
  I added dynamic string and array classes to core. In string class I added static methods to replace standard string methods, changed all games to use them.
  I did some code cleanup.
05.04.2010
  I changed Quake 3 to use zlib and libjpeg as standalone libraries, updated them to latest versions.
06.04.2010
  I changed all games to use names Com_Memset and Com_Memcpy for respective functions.
  I started creating common network message class.
07.04.2010
  I did more work on message class. It's almost complete now. I also added separate class for use as command buffer.
  I moved Com_Memset and Com_Memcpy to core, using Quake 3 implementation. Linux assembly code crashes so it's disabled for now.
08.04.2010
  I moved vector math library to core.
  I moved string functions for dealing with file names and parsing to core as static QStr methods.
09.04.2010
  I moved CRC amd MD4 calculation and  command line argument handling functions to core.
10.04.2010
  I disabled asm code of Com_Memcpy and Com_Memset as it also causes problem on Windows.
  I moved most of the cvar code to core.
11.04.2010
  I changed q1 games to use new style of registering cvars.
  I moved command buffer and command execution to core.
13.04.2010
  I started work on unifying file systems. This should be last of the core subsystems that's used everywhere.
15.04.2010
  I fixed a bug I introduced in command parsing that caused Quake 3 to loose network key sync.
18.04.2010
  Work on file access has been completed and most remaining file system code is unified too.
19.04.2010
  In Hexen 2 I added support for maplist.txt file that specifies alternate progs file for specific levels. Now boss levels work.
20.04.2010
  I finished replacing use of stdio with use of file system for game created files like savegames, config files, screenshots etc. and made them all to be created in home directory.
27.04.2010
  I added clipmap to Quake and Hexen 2.
30.04.2010
  More work on Quake clipmap.
02.05.2010
  I started work on merging sound code into a common client librray. I removed support for loading samples as 8 bit. I removed sound compression in Quake 3 as memory is not a problem nowdays.
03.05.2010
  I merged most of the sound mixing code.
04.05.2010
  I merged Linux sound drivers and loading of sounds.
05.05.2010
  I merged remaining sound mixing code.
06.05.2010
  I merged Windows sound drivers.
09.05.2010
  I moved Quake 2 game sources outide of engine sources as they were getting in the way when searching for something in files. I also added sources of mission packs so that I can play them.
02.01.2011
  I decided to go through all previous changes and review them and make sure that there are no changes that break behavior in one of the games. Since in the beginning I didn't have game type variable, things that were merged first may need to be changed and take advantage of it.
04.01.2011
  In Quake 2 Cvar_SetValue was using non-force version of Cvar_Set, so I added separate version that uses it and replaced everywhere in Quake 2 to use it.
  I did some compatibility changes in Cvar_Get.
06.01.2011
  I finished review. Hopefully all broken compatibility has been restored.
07.01.2011
  I moved sound registration and background music playback methods to client lib. I enabled music in all games. Currently on Linux plays like crap, similar to Quake 2 cinematics.
08.01.2011
  Some changes to ALSA driver, music sounds almost good now.
  Changed to compare against sound time in all games.
09.01.2011
  Rearanged fields to fix crash in Quake 3.
  In Quake 3 don't set sfx to NULL in mixing code because code that frees channels later still depends on it.
11.01.2011
  I did more work on sound code merging.
25.01.2011
  I continued work on sound code merging. I changed Quake 2 to use Quake 3 interface for looping sounds.
26.01.2011
  I merged remaining sound code.
28.01.2011
  I merged CD audio drivers.
29.01.2011
  I moved Hexen 2's MIDI driver to client library.
02.02.2011
  I fixed crashed because of use of uninitialised cvars.
  I moved Hexen2's Huffman encoding to net_chan and reused it on Linux. Thanks to sezero for pointing this out.
  I cleaned up some leftovers of serial and IPX network drivers.
04.02.2011
  I stared work on sorting out clipmaps.
14.02.2011
  I moved Quake 2 clip map loading to core.
16.02.2011
  I moved Quake 3 clip map loading to core.
17.02.2011
  I changed Quake and Hexen 2 to also have clip maps.
25.02.2011
  I moved most of the clip map code to core.
28.02.2011
  I moved clip map area portals methods to core.
02.03.2011
  I moved clip map tracing code to core.
04.03.2011
  I merged clip map loading method.
04.03.2011
  I split non-map model code into a separate file, made list of non-map models global so models don't get unloaded on map changes.
07.03.2011
  I created clip map class for non-map models by copyig Quake clip map, removed non-map related code from Quake clip map.
  I changed Quake clip map to reserve space for box on data arrays like later games do.
  I moved core and client libraries to source folder so that libs is for third party libraries.
25.03.2011
  I sorted out QGL stuff. Platform independent stuff is now common. Changed Quake and Hexen 2 to use it.
  I added platform independent wrapper around GetProcAddress functions.
  I removed all workarounds for specific video cards and support for 8-bit textures.
26.01.2011
  I made it compile on 64 bit. Quake and Hexen 2 crash because of prog strings use ints to store pointer offsets which will not work for engine strings. Quake 2 is the only one that runs fine. Quake 3 crashes during file system initialisation.
27.03.2011
  I replaced all uses of vsprintf with Q_vsnprintf to make them all safe against buffer overflows. This fixed crash with newer video cards where extensions string exceeds buffer limits.
28.03.2011
  I fixed crash on 64-bit because of hardcoded pointer size of 4.
29.03.2011
  I took a look at ioquake3 to see how to fix some of the 64-bit issues in Quake 3.
  I created initial version of Quake/Hexen 2 progs VM library, moved some progs globals and QuakeWorlds prog string fnctions to progsvm, changed all games to use them. For now that's all it will have. This made Quake and Hexen 2 run on 64 bit.
  I fixed uses of FS_ReadFile with aray where trailing 0 was expected.
30.03.2011
  I fixed issue with arguments on 64 bit when calling a VM method.
  I started work on merging GLX drivers.
31.03.2011
  I changed SWAP_DRAW_SURF macro to work on 64 bit and fixed playback of cinematics on 64 bit. Quake 3 runs fine now.
31.03.2011
  I merged main GLX initialisation, all games now properly go fullscreen, but those that didn't now don't have input. To fix that I started merging input code as well.
01.04.2011
  I did more work on input. It works in all games, but in Quake 2 mouse has some issues.
  I changed all games to use Quake 3 style key catchers.
  I merged common part for shutting down GLX.
  Yey, OpenGL acceleration works in VirtualBox, that means I can do some testing there.
  I started work on merging Windows GL driver as well.
02.04.2011
  I merged init and shutdown methods of QGL. Everything is common now.
  I removed number of prog strings limit as it was giving problems when goint to the seconf map in Quake. I should add cleanup as well like DarkPlaces does it.
  I started work on common event queue.
03.04.2011
  I decided to stop working on renderer for now and concentrate on merging input and most of the remaining system specific code.
05.04.2011
  I changed all games to do adding mouse move to user command in platform independent part.
06.04.2011
  I finished merging input drivers on both Windows and Linux.
07.04.2011
  I started work on network drivers. I removed remaining support for IPX.
09.04.2011
  I merged most of the socket API. I did some testing, QuakeWorld, Hexen 2, Quake 3 work fine. Quake 2 on Linux had problem that was introduced in my work with sockets and was easily fixed. Quake fails with invalid message error. HexenWorld has problem on server where it fails because of an NULL progs functin call.
10.04.2011
  I went back through subversion revisions and tracked down change that broke Quake and fixed it. HexenWorld has this problem even in early revisions, maybe I should try to get different progs from other HexenWorld project.
11.04.2011
  I tried HexenWorld using game data provided by uHexen project and it works. Probably it didn't work because I was using data from beta version.
  I changed Quake and Hexen 2 to use netadr_t like other games.
13.04.2011
  I finished merging platform dependent socket methods.
14.04.2011
  I changed retrieval of local IPs to use different APIs. Now it properly finds all IPs. Unix version should work on MacOSX as well so I removed MacOSX specific code.
  I also merged network address utility methods.
  I think that's enough network code merging for now, as primary goal - system specific code is merged.
15.04.2011
  I rearanged init procedure in Quake/Hexen 2 so that config file is executed before initialising systems that depend on saved settings.
  I added separate flag for Quake 3 latched cvars as there are important differences in their behavior and in Quake 2 it's server side latched cvars should behave as they did, but on client side (i.e. renderer) we want them to behave like in Quake 3. The differences are in the way latched value is applied (Cvar_GetLatchedVars vs Cvar_Get) and the fact that in Quake 2 they are saved in savegame and restored when loading, and we don't want this to be done for renderer vars.
16.04.2011
  I added building of dedicated Quake 2 server on Linux.
17.04.2011
  I merged system console input (of dedicated servers) on Unix and made TTY stuff from Quake 3 available in all games, complete with command completition and history.
19.04.2011
  I moved Windows console window from Quake 3 to core and changed all games to use it.
20.04.2011
  I also merged time get method used in Quake and Hexen 2. I think I can finally get back to rendering.
21.04.2011
  I changed all games to use common video modes, now Quake and Hexen 2 have video mode saved in config.
  I mostly worked on merging GL system stuff. I also merged code from GL system files that was the same on both platforms.
22.04.2011
  I finished merging system specific OpenGL stuff, in all games there are no more system specific OpenGL files.
23.04.2011
  I did some merging of the OpenGL initialisation.
  I started work on image loading. Today I did all 24/32 bit formats supported (BMP, TGA and JPG).
24.04.2011
  I started work on 8-bit images. I merged PCX file loading and saving.
  I added common palette. The way it was stored in Quake was in integer array and had little endian assumptions everywhere. Quake 2 fixed same of this, but still has places where little endian is asumed. New palette is stored as bytes so should not have any problems in case I do a port to some big endian system.
  I added image structure in Quake and Hexen 2 replacing some hacks that were used. This will also prepare them for common image structure later.
25.04.2011
  I'm working on 8-bit images in Quake specific formats. I added common method that handles conversion to 32-bit to simplify loading and unify it to always return 32 bit data. Flood filling of model skins is done in it as well.
  After I gad created common methods for loading LMP and WAL files I could merge loading of all image formats in one method.
  I merged methods for resampling textures and mipmap generation.
26.04.2011
  I merged gamma control. Hardware gamma is now used in all games.
  I removed support for monchrome lightmap formats.
27.04.2011
  I merged method that uploads image data to OpenGL.
  I made compressed texture support available in all games, it's still off by default.
28.04.2011
  I changed all games to use ARB multitexture extension. This actually brought it back in them since SGIS extension is not supported by drivers anymore and thus didn't work.
  I merged image structures and changed everything to use them.
29.04.2011
  I started work on common image creation method.
30.04.2011
  I merged method that creates an image.
  In Quake 2 I removed unloading of unused images as memory is not an issue nowdays and probably later I will do a full reinit of renderer on level change like it's done in Quake 3.
01.05.2011
  I changed loading of embedded model skins and sprites not to search for texture as it will never be found.
  I merged method that either finds or loads an image from file.
  I merged methods and cvars for texture filter.
  I added common default image, the one from Quake 3. Funny, Quake/Hexen 2 also have default mip texture but it's never uploaded to OpenGL.
03.05.2011
  I changed name of the project to jlquake as vquake name was already used by ID. Will also changed SourceForge UNIX name once that service becomes available again.
  I added common initialisation of built-in images.
  I added common method that re-uploads data of an existing image.
04.05.2011
  I merged loading of WAD files.
