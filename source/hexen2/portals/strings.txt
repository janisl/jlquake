I am leaving messages in case I fail to destroy Eidolon. I begin in Castle Blackmarsh where Famine waits. I've heard strange rumors of an invincible Crystal Golem that protects the entrance to Famine's Lair. Perhaps the King's mages know of a way to grant me the power to destroy it. I believe that the Brotherhood of Hunger may hold some clues, and knowing that I must acquire the Amulet of Hunger from the castle treasury. -Tyranith
Our defenses have fallen! The key to our magic is in the hands of the Evil. Death has captured the Four Elements and spread them throughout the realm. Defended by were-jaguars and scorpions, the Elements must be reclaimed to extend the Bridge of Stars. Only when the Elements have been returned will the Well of Souls be opened. I have heard legends hinting at the Test of the Elements, and I can only hope that I will be able to pass all four. -Tyranith
The fiends! Two of Thysis' greatest treasures have been stolen. For the sake of honor, both Crowns must be returned to their resting place! First, I must find the Four Canopic Jars and enter the Afterworld, a place I hoped to never see. I happened upon a gravely wounded scribe who told me to use the Staff of Nefertum to advance the Wheel of Ages. I have put this down as the delirium of a dying man, let us hope that this is the case. -Tyranith
Again, the foul creatures have stolen items of great power from the people of Thyrion. In order to return these items of import, I will first need to gain entrance to the reflecting pool. Unfortunately, I carry no items for donation. Let us hope that the temple priests have left enough behind to pay the tithe. -Tyranith
Curse Eidolon, for all that I have done has been for naught! Even now I hear the dreadful stomp of Eidolon's Golems spelling my doom. The Chaos Sphere, Eidolon's power source, has resurrected the Dark Generals who have already reclaimed what was taken from them. Alas, I have no warning of lies ahead for I can only see my death. As I ready my weapons for one final assault, I pray that my death was not in vain. Someone must destroy Eidolon. -Tyranith
You've found Tyranith's body!

As the last traces of Famine are pulled into the depths of the Nether Dimension, weariness fills your very soul.  This was but the first of the Dark Generals, who can guess what terrors await you, guarding the dark secrets of their awful master, Eidolon.  Still, the lifeblood of your entire race depends on the sharpness of your wits and the edge of your blade.  Do you have the strength to defeat all of Eidolon's foul legions?@@To carry the fight to Eidolon, please purchase the full version of hexen II... Thyrion needs your help.
With the destruction of Eidolon and his four Dark Generals, Thyrion is once again free from the darkness that had enshrouded it.  As the news of Eidolon's defeat spreads like wildfire throughout the land, the cries of victory rise from millions of lips.  Narrowly, we have avoided genocide.
Given time, our nations shall grow strong again and our people shall prosper.  Once the last vestiges of Eidolon's foul machinations and troops are swept from Thyrion, the world shall return to normal.  Even now, our most powerful magicians are weaving spells to forever entrap the root of the Serpent Rider's power, the remains of the Chaos Sphere.  For if even mere shards of the Chaos Sphere still exist, so does deadly evil.  Fortunately, its masters have all been destroyed.  And so, the final chapter is written in the Chronicle of Deeds.  It is with a light heart that I set down my quill and close the tome that lies before me.
For with the fall of Eidolon, there is nothing left to fear.
As the mystical energies released by the destruction of Famine swirl the air before you, a sense of urgency overwhelms you as the very fabric of space is torn asunder.  Hurled instantly across vast distances, you find yourself in the land of Mazaera.  While the nausea from the teleportation begins to fade, you ready your weapons and survey the landscape before you.  Once teeming with life, now there is only a dark silence.  As the oppressive heat threatens to suffocate, you begin the next leg of your journey.  Regardless of the path you choose, Death awaits you.
As the screams of Death fade to silence, you are once again ripped through the ethereal plane.  Sunlight shines down from the uncaring heavens and you recognize your surroundings as the land of Thysis.  Once a cultural haven for learning and art, the land is now a barren, deserted place.  Deep within his hidden stronghold lies Pestilence, master of curses and pain.  It was his diseases and plagues that decimated the people of Thysis, allowing Eidolon to enter this realm with barely a fight.  Perhaps now, with your newfound abilities and weapons, a cure has finally arrived.  
As the killing blow falls, Pestilence is enveloped in a cloud of energy, forever removing the blight of his scabrous body from the face of Thyrion.  Once again, there is a sickening twist and you find yourself in the land of Septimus, Thyrion's final defense against the coming of Eidolon.  In a sick sort of irony, it seems fitting that the Dark General known as War would rule the most militaristic civilization in the world.  Taking a few minutes of much needed rest, you reflect on what you have accomplished.  You wonder to yourself, what sort of powerful being could bend the Dark Generals to his whim?  
Once again you are victorious, and once again you are magically teleported to another realm.  Still, something is not right, you have a feeling of deja vu.  What sort of vile trickery is this?  You have returned to the land of Blackmarsh, where you first began this heroic adventure.  This entire time, while you hunted down and destroyed the Dark generals, you were within leagues of the darkest heart ever to stalk humanity.  With a renewed vigor, you begin what might be the hardest test of your life.  But the question remains, can Eidolon be defeated in his lair?  There is only one way to find out, and knowing this you begin the last part of your adventure.
You found a secret area!

Nothing will stand in your way.@----------@At least, not after you buy the full version of Hexen 2!@----------@No sheep were harmed in the making of this demo.

...I don't know what to do about Razumen.  He knows of the magic portal in the King's Tomb within the Hall of the Dead.  He hopes to use it to his advantage.  Because of this madness, I have used my seal to lock away his spells so he will not gain entrance to the tomb.
Hmmm...this must be Razumen.  Looks like he never made it to town.
I made my way down the village well to find out why the water supply has become tainted.  What I found was at once astounding and confusing.  An underground castle sits inside these cavernous regions and Eidolon's minions are about.  Perhaps Razumen back in the village can shed light on this situation.
Watchman's Log -  A strange man in flowing robes appeared near the well.  Paramor approached him to question his intentions, and was instantly changed into a sheep.  I am ashamed for hiding, but what can one do against powerful magics?  I last saw the sorcerer heading towards the Duke's Keep.

Meanwhile, the Demoness finds Eidolon's body missing and goes into his castle in search of the one who is responsible
The heroes catch a fleeting image of the Demoness disappearing through the hole in the earth
Gritting their teeth, they follow her into the darkness
After Eidolon's defeat, the heroes returned to their homelands thinking that evil had finally been defeated.  Months passed with no sign of any trouble.  However, one day a strange winter suddenly overtook all of Thyrion.  The heroes returned to Eidolon's lair to investigate the strange happenings.  Upon their arrival, they discovered a large hole in the earth and the image of a demoness disappearing into it.  Gritting their teeth, they followed her into the darkness.
